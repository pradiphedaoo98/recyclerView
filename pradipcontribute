RecyclerView overview
The RecyclerView widget is a more advanced and flexible version of ListView.

In the RecyclerView model, several different components work together to display your data.
The overall container for your user interface is a RecyclerView object that you add to your layout.
The RecyclerView fills itself with views provided by a layout manager that you provide. 
You can use one of our standard layout managers (such as LinearLayoutManager or GridLayoutManager), or implement your own.
